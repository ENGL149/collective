  		The Fall semester of 2021 was my first semester attending The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And, unsurprisingly, it was rather vexing. I changed my major on the very first day of class and had to swap out half my classes after I had already spent hundreds of non-refundable dollars on textbooks. Switching from a major in Business Administration to one in English and Comparative Literature with a focus in Writing, Editing, and Digital Publishing was a pretty dramatic transition, and as a consequence, none of my previous classes were compatible with the change. Fortunately, I was able to remedy the issue with relative ease and enrolled myself in four classes – Spanish 203, Astronomy 102, Stylistics in Poetry, and studies in Sci-Fi/Fantasy.</p>

  			At a glance, that doesn’t sound so bad, does it? Well trust me – it was. My initial excitement to study astronomy was quickly extinguished upon discovering the entirety of the course is composed of physics. It was like learning rocket science…literally. Additionally, Spanish kicked my butt like a professional MMA fighter, but as a non-native Spanish speaker that one seems self-explanatory. My poetry class and my Sci-Fi/Fantasy class weren’t so bad. In fact, I’d even consider the latter to be enjoyable.</p>

  				In place of a textbook, my Sci-Fi/Fantasy class was assigned movies to watch and novels to read. Class-time was spent reflecting on the assigned works and having detailed discussions about them. Many of the conversations held revolved around different concepts within the human condition and society as a whole, which led to some interesting debates and thought processes. This course also led to my discovery of a new guilty pleasure: The Lord of the Rings. More specifically, the movie trilogy. Call me a nerd if you must, I’m just living my truth.</p>

  					Carrying on with the positivity, as I move away from the academic aspect of the semester, my experiences become significantly more cheerful. I joined the <a href="https://youtu.be/iik25wqIuFo">Campus Christian Fellowship</a> (commonly referred to as just ‘CCF’) shortly after arriving on campus in August. Through CCF I was able to encounter a group of amazing people, some of who are now my closest friends. They have shown me the positives of college life, from 2 a.m. study sessions in the Davis library to midnight CookOut runs. For the first time (probably ever), I have formed strong, bona fide bonds with genuine people. Without them, I would have dropped out by now, and I’m not being hyperbolic.</p>

  						Perhaps the ultimate holy grail of my semester was the relocation of my roommate. She was first on my list of reasons to drop out of college. Midway through the semester, my roommate moved out of our dorm and I’m still ecstatic – it was the best thing that could have possibly happened for the sake of my mental health. And truthfully, it’s not personal. Living with someone constantly in such close proximity is suffocating, regardless of who it is. I thrive alone.</p>

  							On a scale of one to ten, I would rate my first semester of college as a six. Nothing ‘super awesome’ happened, but it could have been worse. Generally speaking, attending college is an experience loaded with ups and downs and all we can do is make the best of them. I’m entering the new semester with a positive attitude and high hopes for all the things to come.</p>
