<h2 style="font-size:25"> <i> Autobiography:</i> </h2>
<p>My first semester at Carolina reintroduced me to many aspects of learning that I had grown distant from due to the COVID 19 pandemic. While I was grateful for the Universityâ€™s ability to sustain in person learning, I had not stepped foot in a classroom since March 2020.  As I begin my second semester at UNC though, I feel more prepared and motivated than I ever have.
I took 12 credit hours last semester to provide myself with some flexibility while navigating the transition from high school to college. While the classes I selected were primarily selected to fufill Gen-Eds, I found that the different teaching styles and diverse material increased my overall engagement with academic life. I realized quickly that I was not interested in some fields of study, but what I feel I took away from every class was the opportunity to think about things that I otherwise would have never considered. That process of exploration and reflection is one that I believe is unique to college and higher learning.</p>
<p> I live in a dorm adjacent to Franklin Street, which is the center of social life at UNC. Because I have such close access to all the different restaurants, stores, and venues in the university area, visiting them has been an integral part of my experience at Carolina. I have spent a considerable amount of time exploring the different coffee shops and small business in chapel Hill and it has provided me with an important sense of connection to the area.
I am from Greensboro, NC which is located approximately an hour outside of Chapel Hill. I had reservations about coming to a school so close to home, but after completing my first semester here I could not imagine being anywhere else. UNC, socially, has been a great experience. I have made friends from different parts of the state, country, and world. For example, my suitemates are from Norway and Zambia. Living with them has opened my eyes to the different lifestyles and opportunities that I could find in traveling or working abroad. They have also instilled in me a belief that people can unite and coexist regardless of differing life experience.</p>
<p> One memorable lesson that I will take away from my first semester, is that prioritizing the mental wellbeing of any community is an invaluable asset to personal growth.  While it was exciting to be a new student and gain unique experience, it is easy to forget that we owe one another grace, patience, and empathy. It was so moving to feel the UNC community unite during a time of sadness and loss. I now feel a bigger obligation to be a more engaged friend, student, and stranger. Overall, I was surprised, challenged, and encouraged by my first semester at UNC. <p style="color:blue">I cannot wait to continue making friends and studying here!</p>
