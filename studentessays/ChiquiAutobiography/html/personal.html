    Last semester, I did very well academically compared to my freshman year and I had a way to destress. Also last semester I started dating someone. I didn't mean to date her, we were friends for years at this point, but somewhere along the way I started feeling closer to her. So last semester I finally asked her out and we've been dating ever since the start of last semester. Since I was in class and she was busy with work, it was hard sometimes to find time to do stuff together, but at least once a month we took a couple of days and made it all about us. I really enjoyed these days and it helped get away from my normal routine.
