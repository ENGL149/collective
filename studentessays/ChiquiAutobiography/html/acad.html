    <p style=" text-align: left;text-indent:70px;font-size: 25px;">	Last semester, it was my last fall semester
        as I am now a senior. I had four classes and all of them were comp classes since I am a computer
        science major. At the start I had 5 comp classes, but after a week I realized one of the classes was not
        for me, so I dropped it. Two of the comp classes were difficult and the other two were easy to understand
        the material. This was also the first semester since covid that my classes were all in person. I feel that
         I enjoyed online classes more than in person classes. With online classes, lectures were recorded which
         meant that if I did not understand something I could replay the recording. I could also speed up parts of
          the recording that I understand. Getting to class was also easier as I needed to turn on my computer and
          I was in class. Recording of lectures needs to be continued. It's easy to do and helps students like me
          understand material I did not understand the first time. During the final weeks of September and first
          weeks of October is when most of the workload kicks in. In this time I spent many hours at the library
          getting through it all. At the end of the semester, I realized I would need 5 classes next semester in
          order to graduate. I also realized that this is my last two semester at UNC and after this, I graduate. More about <a href="https://www.unc.edu/">UNC</a> can be found here, for me it was a great school, although at times at was incredily difficult.
