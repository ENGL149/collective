        My Last Semester
      </h1>
      <p>
        The last semester I was at school was Spring 2021. It was a lot like the other “zoom” semester. I would wake up,
        attend a lecture of ~100 people, camera off, and just listen to the professor lecture about some topic in
        computer
        science. I was strictly taking those classes at the time. Honestly, it was boring. Not being in person had a lot
        of
        impacts, I didn’t meet anyone that I didn’t already know, and I was less engaged in my classes than I usually
        was.
        Open note tests meant less studying and so forth. This did have the advantage of saving me a lot of time. The
        absence
        of having to walk to class, hanging out with roommates, etc.
        And so, I became career-focused.
      </p>

      <p>
        After spending all of my days studying <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a> (a website for coding
        interviews) and practicing my answers to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>
            “How would you be a valuable asset to X company?"
          </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            "Give an example of a time where you led a group.”
          </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            And so forth...
          </em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I was fortunate enough to land an internship at <a href="https://www.opendoor.com/">Opendoor</a> and <a
          href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/">TikTok</a>. Now <a href="https://www.opendoor.com/">Opendoor</a> was a
        company
        I
        worked for
        over the summer, my first real “job.” And that’s out of the scope of the prompt. Now <a
          href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/">TikTok</a>, on the other hand, is
        where I spent my time for the Fall 2021 semester.
      </p>
      <p>
        To say I was super excited was an understatement. I mean it was <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/">TikTok</a>!
        My project was making a page that asked the user for their gender when they
        signed
        up for the app.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Z96YNasIzyH69UkKed1AtU9Ks11cOvby"
          alt="This is a picture of the gender selection page" width="300px" height="auto"
          style="display:block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px" />
        <h6 style="text-align: center; font-size:large; color:gray;">The actual page!</h6>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now, I could talk all day about the implementation of that page:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>
            The headaches of having hundreds user sign ups per
            second
          </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            The legal issues with asking people for their gender
          </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Etc, etc...
          </em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      But what I want to focus on are the life lessons this
      experience taught me. It made me scared of what life has to offer after college. With remote work being the norm
      for
      the foreseeable future, I found it hard to make friends at work. Relationships feel <em>platonic</em> - people
      seem
      to be nice
      because of work and how relationships can get you ahead. Time also flies when you are doing the same thing day in
      and
      day out. It’s on you to plan exciting trips and make new moves in life. No more having an auto-reset every 4
      years,
      switching schools, and summer break - where you can make memories with friends and family without a care in the
      world.
      Lastly, it makes me sad to graduate. My time with 10,000+ similar-aged, young adults, or still “kids,” is almost
      over.
      I feel like I haven’t made the memories I wanted to. I mean, I missed out on the first semester back in person
      from
      COVID. As I looked at Snap stories, Instagram posts, I felt like I missed out. Truth is, no matter how much I
      learned
      from <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/">TikTok</a> and how much it helped out my resume and initial career, I
      kind
      of
      <strong>regret</strong> it.
