<h3><u><h3 style="color:white">Introduction:</u></h3>
<p><p style="color:white"><b>I'm currently a sophomore at the <a href=https://www.unc.edu/>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</a> My last semester semester of college put me through some new challenges while giving me some unforgettable experiences. Due to COVID-19, my first semester of college was online and the semester after that I was finally able to arrive on campus. However, classes were still online and I found myself in my dorm quite often. I never had the oppurtunity to have the <i>college experience</i> that everybody talks about till my last semester.</b></p>
<h3><u><h3 style="color:white">Social Environment:</u></h3>
<p><p style="color:white"><b>Last semester I was finally able to meet other students face to face in person and get to know them outside of class. This new social environment allowed me to meet dozens of new friends and I will forever be thankful for that. Along with making new friends, something else that was new this past semester was all the campus activities. I was able to go to trivia nights, art museums, and comedy shows on all campus. This really made me feel a part of the college community and I realized this is what I had wanted from the <u>very beginning.</u></b></p>
<h3><u><h3 style="color:white">COVID:</u></h3>

<p><p style="color:white"><b>Something I really struggled with in coming back to campus again with others was the fear of getting COVID-19 and spreading it to others without me knowing. I enjoyed hanging out with friends but after every social interaction I tried my best to get tested immediately. This fear was always in the back of my head and it was a constant reminder everywhere I looked. The university had constant emails about the pandemic and there were always reminders to get tested on social media. Coming back to in person classes was a relief to me as I struggled with learning online. Wearing masks in classrooms was strange to me at first and I felt distant from other students and my professor. That being said, I now feel like I'm used to this setting and it's my new <i>normal</i>. Thinking about not having masks during classrooms or inside buildings is a strange concept to me.</b></p>
<h3><u><h3 style="color:white">Art:</u></h3>
<p><p style="color:white"><b>The most important thing that came out of last semester for me was the chance to finally take college level art courses. I’m a studio art major and I have always loved art and I took a few classes in highschool to help develop my skills. When I came into college, taking art classes was all I cared about. I wasn’t able to get any my first year and I was worried on how art classes would be translated in an online class format. I was worried that an online version would make me dislike the classes and make it so that it would be difficult for me to improve. This would not be the case due to classes being in person and I was able to take three art courses last semester. I loved every minute of it and they were way better than what I pictured in my head. I even got the chance to visit the <a href=https://ackland.org//> Ackland Art Museum</a> which was amazing! Even though there were new changes and obstacles for me this past semester, I did my best for what I was given and I had an amazing time!</b></p>
