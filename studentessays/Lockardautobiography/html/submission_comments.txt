A few comments about this submission:

- The elements that I included that weren't discuessed in class are: div, figure, figcaption, link, and meta.
   - Meta elements in the head help to reduce display error when viewed from different browsers.
   - The first link element is used to link to the external css stylesheet.
   - The last 3 link elements are used to link to google fonts so that I can display custom fonts
   - Although the figure and figcaption elements are mostly semantic elements, they do slightly alter the display and make styling easier.
- My 2 links are attached to the bottom 2 images under the header "University Links"

Thank you!
