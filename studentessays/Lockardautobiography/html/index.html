                Last semester was crazy for most, we were just coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we were still unsure of what the future looked like.  
                However, since last semester was my first in college, I found it thrilling to finally be able to explore my own identity.  
                For the first time, I was free to do what I wished.

            <h2 class="shead">Choosing Wesley</h2>
            <p>
                Before starting my college career, I had been going to a local Methodist Church for a long time, and I knew that was something that I would want to continue in college.  
                I decided to try out UMC Wesley, a campus ministry in the Methodist Church.  However, I chose to do so with an open mind, since I knew there were many different ministries that I could join.  
                After going to just two events at Wesley, I knew for a fact that it was the best place for me.  Within the first week of college, I had already made a significant decision that would end up becoming the highlight of my first semester.  
                What stood out to me about this decision was that I made it solely on my own and I had no influence from past or current friends whatsoever.

                <figcaption>Early on in my semester, my friends and I often enjoyed going up to Craige Parking Deck to hang out and ride scateboards around.  This particular night we decided to take some pictures on a ledge in front of the UNC watertower.</figcaption>

            <h2 class="shead">Going to the Gym</h2>
            <p>
                To continue, I had another identity-shaking experience later in the semester.  I found that this one was different; instead of choosing on my own, my suitemates influenced me to start going to the gym.  
                My dad had always told me that the gym was a waste of both money and time, and so I never attempted to go.  My suitemates said different, and I decided to give it a try.  
                After my first visit, I knew I was hooked.  I quickly began to construct a gym routine and soon enough was going to the gym three to four times a week.  
                I found that I liked it so much that when I went back home for winter break, I signed up for a one-month membership to a local gym.  This experience showed me that I could expand my identity to include new things.
            </p>
            <h2 class="shead">Working Hard</h2>
            <p>
                My experiences last semester also enabled me to strengthen parts of my identity that I developed in grade school.  More specifically, my focus and dedication to academics.  
                I often found myself with a choice between going out and studying, and I would almost always pick the latter, reasoning that focusing on my schoolwork would enable me to reach the highest level of achievement possible.  
                I found that to be my biggest strength and the thing I considered to be most important to me, and I made sure to put in the hard work necessary so that I could reach that goal.

            <p><br>
                In conclusion, through my individual choices, new influences, and continuing practices from before college, I was able to develop a new identity for myself that was drastically different from the identity that was picked out for me back home.  
                The experience of my first semester of college allowed me to change into more of who I wanted to become.
