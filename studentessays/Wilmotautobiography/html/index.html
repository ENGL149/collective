            <p1>Last semester started off rough, with having to adjust 
to finally having in person classes along with contracting COVID, I was 
not off to the most ideal start. After to my not so ideal start, I 
slowly started to get adjusted to what the 'college life' was. Wake up, 
go to class, eat food, work out, repeat was my life until I got to the 
weekend. The weekend was what I was living for, with a combination of 
hanging out with friends, to watching UNC football, to watching NFL 
football. The weekend was the best time to relax and just be myself and I
 got to experience my 'ideal college life'. Getting to sporting events 
early has always been a passion of mine, and nothing changed as I would 
get to the stadium well before the game would start. <span style="font-size:25px;">üèà</span>Starting the year with high hopes for <a href="https://goheels.com/sports/football" target="_blank">UNC Football</a>,
 I was soon let down as the team did not live up to the extremely high 
expectations. From the collective school spirit and the friends I made 
along the way, I would not trade those experiences for anything. The 
picture on your right is a picture taken after UNC beat Miami and was 
posted on the UNC football twitter. Another favorite moment of mine was 
when <a href="https://247sports.com/college/north-carolina/Article/UNC-Football-Fans-Storm-Field-Win-Over-No-9-Wake-Forest-174682783/" target="_blank"> UNC defeated Wake Forest </a>and
 the student section rushed the field after the victory. Along with 
watching sports, I also started to pick up some lesser-known sports as 
hobbies. I learned how to play both pool and foosball and would strive 
to improve each and every day competing against my friend. At the 
beginning of the semester, I could barely hit the ball straight but 
through constant practice I was not only able to improve my skills, but I
 helped my friend improve as well. This was one of the more enjoyable 
hobbies of mine, because it was outside of my comfort zone and something
 that I was not known for liking.</p1>

            <h4 style="text-align:center;"><b>School Aspect</b><br></h4>
            <p2>My classes on the other hand were not the most 
enjoyable, and I remember just thinking I had to make it to the weekend 
to survive. Having to learn the anatomy of the human body was the 
hardest class I had taken in my life, and it showed me what college was 
truly like. Constant nights staying awake till three in the morning just
 studying away just to repeat the process the next day. It took a real 
hit to my mental health because I had never experienced struggles in the
 classroom before that class. But as the semester went on, I was able to
 meet some other students in the class that helped me find study tips 
that worked for them. I was able to apply what they had previously 
taught me and make better grades on the upcoming tests. Through this 
class I was able to learn the necessity of study, as well as not going 
past the breaking point which will be helpful in my future classes. My 
other classes were not as difficult, but they still had valuable 
information to provide me with for my future endeavors. Through my 
experiences of last semester, I am hoping that I will continue to build 
along getting closer to my end goal of working with athletics of some 
sort after I graduate college.</p2>
