I originally attended Virginia Tech but transferred here to Chapel Hill. It was also my first semester with in-person classes. I moved into a new apartment and started my classes a few days later. Unfortunately, the semester as a whole did not go as planned.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%"> Picking classes was a struggle. I was a philosophy major and had numerous gen-eds to complete. In the end, I chose: Hellenistic Art, Modern Political Thought, Introductory English, Philosophy in Film, and History of Religion in North America. The courses seemed interesting enough during registration, but I quickly realized that the topics just weren't for me. </p>

My professor divided the course into three divisions - humanities, business, and science. I was introduced to the Criterion Channel and was assigned to view movies on the platform. We watch In the Mood for Love (2001), The Virgin Suicides (1999), Yojimbo (1961), and a few other classical or foreign films. </p>

On Criterion, I found a few of my favorite films of all time: Wong Kar Wai’s 1995 Fallen Angels, Andrei Tarkovsky’s Stalker, and Matthei Kassovtiz’s La Haine. The exposure to foreign cinema introduced me to a topic that I actually few in love with. I now hope to either double major or minor in film studies. </p>

I attended events with the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies (Diphi), Philosophy club, and the Parr Center for Ethics. Though, I couldn’t really see myself becoming a member of the organizations. </p>

It was a last-minute trip and I was set to stay just one week before returning to Chapel Hill. I was happy to see my parents, my siblings, and, my dog. The first few days were spent just exploring the new state. I went hiking, saw the gondolas in the city, and had the renowned Oklahoma steak. Toward the end of my stay, due to unforeseen circumstances, I was hospitalized. I was in the hospital for five days, missing my return flight. Because of this, my parents wanted me to stay with them for a while. Given my unhappiness with my situation in Chapel Hill, I wasn’t too upset, but this marked the end of my Fall 2021 academic semester. </p>

I worked Doordash in my free time and enjoyed the holidays. Just before the start of the new semester, I came back to Chapel Hill. Now, I’m happy to be back in North Carolina and am excited for the semester. </p>
