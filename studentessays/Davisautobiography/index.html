  <p style="margin-right:500px; margin-left: 50px; font-family:georgia; color:#000041; font-size: 120%">My <b>Fall 2021 semester at UNC</b> is one that I am unlikely to forget. With it being my first semester on campus after a year of online schooling from my bedroom in Wilmington, I was excited to finally partake in the “normal” college experience—or so I thought. We may have been able to take classes in person, but the overall energy of the first half of my sophomore year was largely dependent on my hesitations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the implications it could have on the lives of everyone at the university.</p>

  <p style="margin-right:500px; margin-left: 50px; font-family:georgia; color:#000041; font-size: 120%">It is evident that a successful college experience relies heavily on one’s ability to shoulder the different aspects of their life, especially with this being a period of immense change for many. College serves as a principal stepping stone into adulthood that tests students in more ways than those strictly academic. Young people are living away from home for the first time and must uphold the responsibility of caring for themselves entirely on their own. In order to prosper during this period, students must be able to balance their academics and social interactions and, in turn, prioritize their mental health. It can be increasingly difficult to fulfill these innate needs in a college setting, especially during a pandemic with as isolating a nature as this one.</p>

  <p style="margin-right:500px; margin-left: 50px; font-family:georgia; color:#000041; font-size: 120%">In my own experience, I have often felt separated from what I have always expected to be the best four years of my life. It is challenging to meet new people in class when masks prevent us from connecting a face with a name. Without the major identifier that is the bottom half of a person’s face, I struggle to recognize people without their masks on. It is the strangest feeling, even unsettling at times, to think that I know what someone looks like only to be entirely off the mark. Don’t get me wrong, I fully support the mandates that require masks to be worn in all indoor areas, but that has been my other dilemma. The social gatherings that one wouldn’t think twice about attending during normal times can pose such unnecessary risks in today’s virus ridden world considering that many college students have no interest in masking up at parties or other events outside of the classroom. I simply do not feel that it is safe or even considerate for me to indulge in the “normal” college experience when my actions can put more than just myself at risk. I may miss out on some of the core memories made in college, but I would rather experience a little <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fomo">FOMO</a> than put another person’s life in jeopardy.</p>

  <p style="margin-right:500px; margin-left: 50px; font-family:georgia; color:#000041; font-size: 120%">I know many other students feel similarly and can attest to how refraining from such social events can lead to loneliness or other feelings that can compromise our mental health. By not participating in these gatherings, I have found that the academic aspect of my life continues to weigh heavier everyday, offsetting the balance that is so necessary in maintaining a healthy mindset while in school. Even though many classes are currently online, I am optimistic that this lack of social stimulation now will help deescalate the severity of the pandemic and bring it to a close sooner. Only with these stipulations in place will it be safe for me to experience college as the millions of people have before me.</p>
