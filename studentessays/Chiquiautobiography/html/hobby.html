    In order to help ease my stress with classes I also had hobbies.
    These hobbies were playing video games and going to the gym both with friends.
    I went to Ram's gym and depending on the time, the gym would be full.
    This is not good as it delayed my workout which slowly started to deteriorate my motivation to go to the
    gym. I tried the SRC but that gym was even busier than rams. I started playing different video games when
    I wasnâ€™t going to the gym. It helps me destress and to do something fun with my friends. I played FPS games
     that could be played competitively such as Overwatch, Apex legends, and COD: vanguard. Ever since I was little
      I could always play any fps game at the highest level, so I still do. I most enjoyed Apex Legends as it's
      the only time I can play something with my brother. Here is a link,<a href="https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/all/Hhxdez">https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/all/Hhxdez</a> ,
      that will show you some money I earned while playing in tournamnets with my brother.
