<p style="font-size:110%; margin: 0px 40px 0px 40px">Last semester was quick, but stressful.  I took four classes including Art History 113, History 220, Math 381, and Chemistry 101. Art History wasn’t particularly my favorite. The topics of the course were not interesting to me, so it was extremely hard to pay attention in class. Also, the professor primarily read directly off of the PowerPoint slides, which became very boring. I really enjoyed History 220, which was about the history of the Olympics and how the Olympics has become political. One of my favorite stories from the class was about the 1904 marathon. The athletes were put through extreme conditions, which can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl6Onu-mhVs">here</a>. Math 381 was also not my favorite. I really like math because I am very analytical, however, Math 381 is all proof based. I would prefer using theorems in problems rather than proving them. The last class that I took was Chemistry 101, which I thoroughly enjoyed; I liked learning about different chemical formulas and reactions. I also had a friend, Kylie, in the class, which made me look forward to coming to class every day. I also think I enjoyed chemistry a lot because it came naturally to me, and I did not have to study a lot in order to remember the concepts.

    <td><p style="font-size:110%; margin: 0px 40px 0px 0px">My semester was also filled with swimming. Being on the UNC swim team requires nine swim practices, three lifts, and two dryland workouts a week. This totals to about twenty-four hours a week. Being a competitive swimmer in college is difficult, but I enjoy how disciplined it makes me. To succeed in the pool and in the classroom, you must have a schedule to follow every day. My typical day starts at practice from 6 am to 8 am, classes from 9:00 – 12:00, dryland or lift workout at 1:00, practice from 2:30 – 4:30, and finally homework and dinner until bedtime. This schedule repeats every day of the week. While this is sometimes overwhelming, I would never trade it for the world; the girls on my team are my best friends and we are truly a family.</p></td>

<p style="font-size:110%; margin: 0px 40px 0px 40px">We had five meets last semester against Queens University, NC State, UGA, Georgia Tech, and the NC State invitational. We pulled out wins against Queens University and Georgia Tech. My best meet was the NC State Invite where I swam the 200 IM, 400 IM, 100 Breaststroke, and 200 Breaststroke. I went lifetime bests in the 100 Breaststroke, 200 Breaststroke, and 200 IM for the first time in four years! A video of one of my races can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI46qB5QmeI&list=PLDol9pfq2lTiaVBjkspfy7wj0CUc-80jP&index=1">here</a>. I am in lane 6 (two lanes from the top). I left that meet feeling extremely confident in myself and was excited for training to come.</p>

<p style="font-size:110%; margin: 0px 40px 0px 40px">Because swimming takes up so much of my time, I was not able to go back home to Atlanta until Christmas. I got very homesick over the course of the semester and wished that my family lived closer. I love going to school and swimming at UNC, but sometimes I hoped that my parents could visit more often. Even with this difficulty, my fall semester was so much fun; I can't wait for many more in Chapel Hill!</p>
