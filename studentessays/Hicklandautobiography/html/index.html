<p style="line-height:2">
A systematic yet straightforward way of encapsulating my last semester, but my time was far from just a season and some numbers.
Last semester was a <b>beginning, a promise, and most importantly, an awakening.</b> My name is <span style="color:white"><span style="background-color:#13294B">Justin Hickland</span><Span style="color:black"><span style="line-height:2">, and coming into my sophomore year of college, you might expect me to be filled with <b>excitement and joy</b> at returning to the campus. Instead, I was <b>scared and uncertain</b> as I was still recovering from almost two semesters of my college experience at home after being kicked off campus due to several COVID-19 outbreaks. </p1>
  <br> <br>
<p2>
 I came in fresh with a <b>new dorm, new suitemates, and in-person classes.</b> I was <b>overwhelmed</b>, to say the least, because I felt like I was just starting college even though I was no longer the newest student on campus. I stayed <b>optimistic</b>, and thankfully my semester began to take shape. I lived in a suite of eight guys on the second floor of Morrison residence hall. We were all <b>quite different</b> since we were randomly assigned to each other, but <b>I couldn’t ask for better suitemates.</b> We grew to know each other well throughout the semester over <b>game nights, dinners, and my suitemate D’Andre’s strike system.</b> We had quite a few laughs, and I feel <b>comfortable</b> with any of them at my side. </p2>
<br> <br>
<p3>
Another essential piece to know about me is that I am an <b>undecided major</b>. As a result, my classes are always quite <b>random</b> because I solely focus on completing general education courses, and last semester was no exception. I took <a href="https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/fren/">French cuisine</a>, <a href="https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/aaad/">intro to Africa</a>, <a href="https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/comm/">media and popular culture</a>, <a href="https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/span/">beginner Spanish</a>, and <a href="https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/geol/">geology</a>. The difference this semester is I was taking classes in person for the <b>first time since the pandemic started.</b> As crazy as all these classes sound, Spanish by far was the <b>hardest</b>. I don’t understand our society’s obsession with people learning a language later in life when the older we are, the harder it is to learn a language. It is not that I do not want to learn Spanish; I just do not believe it should be the <b>most challenging class</b> when I do not plan to use the language in my future career. Despite my struggles with Spanish, I found an interest in all of my other classes. My favorite by far was <b>media and popular culture.</b> This was the only class I chose out of my <b>interests</b> and not to meet a requirement. It was well worth it because I could utilize my <b>talents</b> and knowledge of media I enjoy, to contribute to class and make friends. The most surprising course I took was my <b>French cuisine class.</b> I had no prior experience in French cuisine but quickly fell in love with all the subtle implications food has in our everyday lives. My other courses definitely played a part in my semester, but they felt comparable to previous high school or online classes I had experienced before. Therefore, these classes offered differing experiences that influenced and shaped my academic and social interactions for <b>a mostly ideal semester back on campus.</b> </p3>
<br> <br>
<p4>
Overall, fall 2021 was a semester that started with <b>uncertainty</b> and left me with more questions than I came in with but ultimately set up the <b>groundwork</b> for the rest of my college experience.
