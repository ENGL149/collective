<p style="font-family:georgia; text-align: center; line-height:1.8"> Despite last semester being my
third semester as a UNC student, it was only my first
semester on campus. Yes, that is right, I am indeed a member of the infamous Class of 2020. <br>
Having my entire first year of college virtually was obviously not the way I had pictured it;
however, it meant that my anticipation and excitement <br> were at an all-time high for my first
semester on campus. I had to walk around and find all my classrooms like a freshman, learn
about different campus resources like a freshman, <br> and adjust to the overall college experience
like a freshman. But I was not a freshman; and this knowledge motivated me to make the most
of my time on campus <br> at Chapel Hill since I had already lost two out of my eight semesters. </p> <br>

<p style="font-family:georgia; text-align:center; line height: 1; color:darkseagreen;"> <b> The day I decided to attend Chapel Hill </b> <br> <br>
<p style="font-family:georgia; text-align: center; line-height:1.8"> Last semester, I did a nice job
balancing schoolwork with extracurriculars and downtinme. I only took twelve credit hours because it
was my first semester <br> on campus and I wanted to be
able to get involved without bogging myself down in homework. My four courses were a
combination of <br> general education requirements with major and minor specific courses that all
piqued my interest without overwhelming me. I will say, the <b> 8:00 AM </b> <br> Art History was a little
difficult, only because of the time of day. Rolling out of bed to go sit in a dark room was a <i> risky
choice </i> on my part, but I did well overall. <br> In terms of grades, I had my best semester yet (I think
learning in person was a large contribution to that), but it was the ways I was involved outside <br> of
the classroom that truly made last semester special. </p> <br>

<p style="font-family:georgia; text-align: center; line-height: 1.8"> I have danced since the age of two and never given it up. I danced competitively from
age five all the way through my senior year of <br> high school and dance was something I wanted to
have with me as a constant when I transitioned from high school to college. I joined a dance
group at UNC <br> called Carolina Vibe and for my first year we danced completely over Zoom. Do not
get me wrong, dancing over Zoom was fun, but it was in a room alone, <br> watching a laptop,
instead of being in a studio with my friends. At the start of last semester, we met in person for
the first time and I knew I had friends for life. <br> Everyone is so loving and supportive and I
seriously could not have asked for a better group of friends. I loved talking about hard courses
some of the older <br> girls had already taken, and meeting the new freshmen who were going to
love the group as much as I did. <br> They gave me a sense of peace and community, even in such
a chaotic time. </p> <br>

<p style="font-family:georgia; text-align: center; line-height: 1.8"> My first <b> REAL </b> semester of college went so much better than I could have ever expected
and it made me excited for the <br> rest of the memories I am going to make as a Carolina student. <br> I
think dealing with a tough first year made me realize that I cannot take the rest of my time in
college for granted. </p>
