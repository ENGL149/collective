<h1> College as a Personalized Experience</h1>
<h3>By Jonay Sutton</h3>

<p style="font-family:georgia;">
My sophomore year fall semester was like catching up on everything students missed out on.
It was all a rush, a rush to get that college experience-which means different things to each person.
For me it was building solid friendships,going to class in person, going to concerts again, and feeling a
part of a live community. I’m in the middle of my education at UNC,and my first semester as a freshman started
off bitter, the one following was incomplete, and the last one was drawing off of those abnormal and previous
semesters.

I spent last fall not really making any new friendships, but instead bonding closer to the people
that were with me through the end of the spring 2021.I would say, this is better than the former.
We could finally sit inside boba restaurants together, and me and my roommate-who’s become my close
friend found the Local 506-where we go to randomly see shows by artists we don’t know. Now we’re getting
an apartment together. Friendships are one of the most important aspects about going to college. There’s
a chance for everyone to start new, and hopefully long-lasting ones.

Being physically present in class was critical for me because I didn’t feel isolated and withdrawn
from my education. I realized the importance of being among other academic peers, that is, really
being there, sitting side by side and talking to each other. I performed so much better in my classes
than I did the previous semester. This was mainly due to my increased willingness to participate in an
in-person setting. Each of my classes felt impactful for me, and I finally started taking classes in the
majors that I truly wanted to study. My philosophy and English classes taught me the most, and what I
learned is useful in all of my courses.

Another key lesson for me last semester was making sure that nothing I was learning was outside of
my interest. School is better for me when I’m actually studying my genuine interests and things that
intrigue me. It wasn’t environmental science or biology (my previous majors), and it took a lot of
confidence to finally choose my majors. Partly because humanities majors are always labeled as “useless”
or “taking the easy way out”. One thing my philosophy class taught me was that there was nothing easy about
reading and understanding Kant and Schopenhauer.

There is no one singular way to gain the “experience”; everything that makes being in college special
is different for everyone. A lot of people think about college as going to frat parties every weekend,
spending hours on homework, and going to sporting events. With the exception of homework, those aspects
weren’t a part of my previous semester, and not that there’s anything wrong with those, they aren’t for
me. I spent my time sitting on our rug watching movies with my roommate, constantly eating out on franklin
street, going to shows, and spending time in the cemetery.  My semester was on the subtler side (with the
exception of punk shows), and it showed
me what brings me the most joy. </p>
